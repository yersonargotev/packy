## Golden placement rule

Place code at the narrowest stable owner:

1. **One agent only** -> adapter package.
2. **One component across agents** -> component package.
3. **Ordering or dependencies** -> planner.
4. **Execution lifecycle** -> pipeline.
5. **Interactive state only** -> TUI.
6. **User command surface** -> CLI plus docs.

## Contributor checklist

- [ ] Confirm the change has one clear owner.
- [ ] Avoid copying path rules between adapters.
- [ ] Keep generated/user state out of `internal/assets/`.
- [ ] Update docs at the entry point users will actually read.
