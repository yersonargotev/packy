## Missing-source references

| Requested topic | Traceable conclusion |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | No dashboard, HTMX, or HTTP server package was found in this repository. |
| Cloud sync | No cloud server/cloud store implementation was found in this repository. |
| Engram store schema | Sessions, observations, prompts, relations, and sync mutations are external Engram runtime concepts, not Gentle-AI source files. |
| Full API reference | No `DOCS.md` exists in this repository; use existing focused docs and external Engram docs when needed. |

## Review checklist

- [ ] Every new claim points to a source file or an existing doc.
- [ ] Missing features are labeled as missing, not implied.
- [ ] README links to the guide landing page, not deep subpages.
