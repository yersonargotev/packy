# Kiro IDE

← [Back to README](../README.md)

---

This document explains how gentle-ai integrates with **Kiro IDE** and what is installed in your local Kiro configuration.

## Overview

gentle-ai supports Kiro as a **native-subagent** platform (`kiro-ide`).

When configured, gentle-ai installs:

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Steering file | `~/.kiro/steering/gentle-ai.md` |
| Native SDD agents | `~/.kiro/agents/sdd-{phase}.md` *(10 files)* |
| Skills directory | `~/.kiro/skills/` |
| MCP config | `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` *(separate root — see note below)* |

> **Auto-install not supported.** Kiro must be installed manually before running gentle-ai.
> Download from: [kiro.dev/downloads](https://kiro.dev/downloads)

## Detection

gentle-ai uses **two signals** to detect Kiro:

1. **`~/.kiro` directory presence** — used by `system.ScanConfigs` for the install/TUI auto-detection flow. If `~/.kiro` exists on disk, Kiro is shown as detected in the installer, regardless of whether the binary is on `PATH`.
2. **`kiro` binary on `PATH`** — used by `adapter.Detect()` for the sync/upgrade flow and to confirm the IDE is actually runnable.

In practice: **the installer detects Kiro from `~/.kiro`**, not from `PATH`. If you have Kiro installed but `~/.kiro` hasn't been created yet (e.g., before first launch), run Kiro once to initialize its config dir, then re-run `gentle-ai install`.

## SDD Execution Model

Kiro runs with **native sub-agent delegation** via `~/.kiro/agents/`.

The orchestrator stays in the steering file and coordinates phase execution, while each phase runs in its dedicated Kiro agent file:

```
sdd-init → sdd-explore → sdd-propose → sdd-spec → sdd-design → sdd-tasks → sdd-apply → sdd-verify → sdd-archive (+ sdd-onboard)
```

This follows the same SDD architecture used in gentle-ai: orchestrator coordinates, phase agents execute, Engram persists artifacts across phases.

**Approval gates** remain required before `apply` and `archive`.

## Native Kiro Specs Integration

Kiro has a built-in spec workflow that gentle-ai leverages. For medium and large changes, the orchestrator will use native Kiro artifacts at:

```
.kiro/specs/<feature>/
├── requirements.md
├── design.md
└── tasks.md
```

**Steering files** at `.kiro/steering/*.md` provide persistent workspace context across sessions — treat them like always-on system context for your project conventions, architecture decisions, and team rules.

**Size classification** routes tasks through Small / Medium / Large paths to decide planning depth:

| Size | Approach |
|------|----------|
| Small | Inline — no formal SDD phases |
| Medium | Kiro native specs (`.kiro/specs/`) + Engram |
| Large | Full SDD cycle: explore → propose → spec → design → tasks → apply → verify → archive |

---

## Steering File Format

The steering file written by gentle-ai uses the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
inclusion: always
---
```

`inclusion: always` ensures Kiro loads this context in every conversation automatically, regardless of workspace or file type.

## Native Agent Frontmatter

Kiro SDD phase agents are generated with YAML frontmatter including:

- `name`
- `description`
- `tools`
- `model`
- `includeMcpJson: true`

The `model` value is injected during sync from Kiro model assignments (`auto|opus|sonnet|haiku|minimax|glm|deepseek|qwen`) to Kiro-native model IDs.

## Config Paths by Platform

### macOS

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Global config dir | `~/Library/Application Support/Kiro/User` |
| Steering file | `~/.kiro/steering/gentle-ai.md` |
| Skills dir | `~/.kiro/skills/` |
| Settings path | `~/Library/Application Support/Kiro/User/settings.json` |
| MCP config | `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` |

### Windows

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Global config dir | `%APPDATA%\kiro\User` |
| Steering file | `%USERPROFILE%\.kiro\steering\gentle-ai.md` |
| Skills dir | `%USERPROFILE%\.kiro\skills\` |
| Settings path | `%APPDATA%\kiro\User\settings.json` |
| MCP config | `%USERPROFILE%\.kiro\settings\mcp.json` |

### Linux (XDG)

| Artifact | Path |
|----------|------|
| Global config dir | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kiro/user` *(fallback: `~/.config/kiro/user`)* |
| Steering file | `~/.kiro/steering/gentle-ai.md` |
| Skills dir | `~/.kiro/skills/` |
| Settings path | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kiro/user/settings.json` |
| MCP config | `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` |

## ⚠️ Split-Root Layout

Kiro uses a **split-root layout** — gentle-ai managed files and IDE settings live in different directories:

- **Steering, skills, and native agents** → `~/.kiro/` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.kiro\` on Windows)
  - `~/.kiro/steering/gentle-ai.md` — orchestrator persona
  - `~/.kiro/skills/` — SDD skill files
  - `~/.kiro/agents/` — SDD phase subagents
- **IDE settings** → platform-native Kiro User dir (`settings.json` only)
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Kiro/User/settings.json`
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\kiro\User\settings.json`
  - Linux: `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kiro/user/settings.json`
- **MCP config** → always `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.kiro\settings\mcp.json` on Windows)

If MCP tools are not loading, check `~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`.  
If Kiro app settings are not applying, check the platform-native User dir (`settings.json`).  
If gentle-ai skills or steering are missing, check `~/.kiro/skills/` and `~/.kiro/steering/`.
