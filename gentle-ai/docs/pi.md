# Pi Agent

← [Back to README](../README.md)

Pi support installs the Gentleman harness as Pi packages, then lets Pi own its own persona, models, SDD agents, chains, and memory wiring.

## Quick Start

1. Install Pi and make sure `pi` is available on `PATH`.
2. Install the Pi support stack from Gentle AI:

```bash
gentle-ai install --agent pi
```

3. Start Pi in your project:

```bash
pi
```

Gentle AI detects the `pi` binary first. If Pi is the only selected agent, the installer still provisions the real Engram component, but skips persona, ecosystem component selection, and Strict TDD prompts because `gentle-pi` owns those choices inside Pi.

## Installed Packages

Gentle AI runs exactly these Pi setup steps:

```bash
pi install npm:gentle-pi
pi install npm:gentle-engram
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
npm exec --yes --package gentle-engram@latest -- pi-engram init
pi install npm:pi-subagents-j0k3r
pi install npm:pi-intercom
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question
pi install npm:pi-web-access
pi install npm:@juicesharp/rpiv-todo
pi install npm:pi-btw
```

| Package                                                  | What it adds                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`gentle-pi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gentle-pi)   | Gentleman persona, SDD/OpenSpec workflow, strict TDD support, safety policy, skills, prompts, SDD agents, and SDD chains. |
| [`gentle-engram`](https://pi.dev/packages/gentle-engram) | Pi integration for Engram session memory and MCP tools. It is not the Engram binary itself.                               |
| `pi-mcp-adapter`                                         | Lets Pi expose MCP servers, including Engram, through Pi's MCP runtime.                                                   |
| `pi-engram init`                                         | Initializes the Pi Engram MCP config shape owned by `gentle-engram`.                                                      |
| `pi-subagents-j0k3r`                                      | Runs SDD agents discovered from `.pi/agents/`; installed from the published Pi package `npm:pi-subagents-j0k3r`.                 |
| `pi-intercom`                                            | Lets child agents ask the parent Pi session for decisions while chains run.                                               |
| `@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question`                     | Lets Pi child agents ask the active user session for clarification when they need human input.                            |
| `pi-web-access`                                          | Adds web access tools for Pi.                                                                                             |
| `@juicesharp/rpiv-todo`                                  | Adds todo/task tracking support for Pi sessions.                                                                          |
| `pi-btw`                                                 | Adds BTW companion workflow support for Pi.                                                                               |

`gentle-pi` owns Pi's runtime behavior. Its current harness enforces parent-only delegation triggers: delegate exploration after 4+ files, use one writer for multi-file changes, require fresh review before PRs, run fresh audits after incidents, and pause long monolithic sessions before they drift.

The real Engram component is provisioned separately by Gentle AI so `gentle-engram` has an Engram runtime to talk to.
During that Engram provisioning step, Gentle AI declares `npm:pi-mcp-adapter` in Pi's agent settings and adds the npm dependency. Existing unrelated Pi settings, package entries, and npm dependencies are preserved.

Files updated by Gentle AI's Engram provisioning:

```text
.pi/agent/settings.json    # packages includes npm:pi-mcp-adapter
.pi/npm/package.json       # dependencies.pi-mcp-adapter = ^2.6.0
```

`gentle-engram` owns the MCP schema itself. The installer runs `pi-engram init`, which initializes Pi's Engram MCP config under the Pi agent config directory instead of having Gentle AI hand-write that file.

## Pi Commands

Run these inside Pi after installing the package stack.

| Command                          | What it does                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/gentle-ai:status`              | Shows package, SDD asset, OpenSpec, and model config status.                                                    |
| `/gentleman:persona`             | Switches between `gentleman` and `neutral` personas.                                                            |
| `/gentle-ai:persona`             | Compatibility alias for `/gentleman:persona`.                                                                   |
| `/gentleman:models`              | Opens the Pi-native model assignment modal.                                                                     |
| `/gentle-ai:models`              | Compatibility alias for `/gentleman:models`.                                                                    |
| `/sdd-init`                      | Bootstraps or refreshes `openspec/config.yaml`.                                                                 |
| `/gentle-ai:install-sdd`         | Reinstalls SDD assets without overwriting local files.                                                          |
| `/gentle-ai:install-sdd --force` | Force-refreshes installed SDD assets. Use this when you explicitly want package assets to replace local copies. |

## Persona Selection

Pi persona selection belongs to `gentle-pi`, not the Gentle AI installer.

```text
/gentleman:persona
```

| Persona     | Behavior                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gentleman` | Teaching-oriented senior architect persona with Rioplatense Spanish/voseo when the user writes Spanish.                    |
| `neutral`   | Same senior architect discipline and teaching philosophy, but with warm professional language and no regional expressions. |

The selection is saved at:

```text
.pi/gentle-ai/persona.json
```

Run `/reload` or start a new Pi session after switching if the current session already injected the previous persona.

## Model Assignments

Pi model assignment belongs to `gentle-pi`, not the Gentle AI installer.

```text
/gentleman:models
```

The modal discovers project, user, and built-in agents. SDD agents are shown first so you can tune the phases that matter most.

| Agent kind                     | Recommended model shape                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exploration, proposal, archive | Fast and cheap is usually enough.                                    |
| Spec, design, tasks            | Strong reasoning model, because these phases shape implementation.   |
| Apply                          | Strong coding model with reliable tool use.                          |
| Verify / review agents         | Strong fresh-context model. Verification benefits from independence. |
| Tiny utility agents            | Inherit the active/default model unless they become a bottleneck.    |

Saved config:

```text
.pi/gentle-ai/models.json
```

Applied configuration:

```text
.pi/agents/*.md
.pi/settings.json
```

Use `Inherit active/default model` to remove an agent override.

## Project Files

On normal Pi `session_start`, `gentle-pi` copies project-local assets without overwriting local edits:

```text
.pi/agents/sdd-*.md
.pi/chains/sdd-*.chain.md
.pi/gentle-ai/support/strict-tdd.md
.pi/gentle-ai/support/strict-tdd-verify.md
```

Use `/gentle-ai:install-sdd --force` only when you want to replace local SDD assets with the package version.

If you start Pi with `pi -ns`, Pi skips startup skill loading/hooks. That mode is useful for a clean or faster Pi session, but it also means `gentle-pi` startup work such as asset checks and skill-registry refreshes will not run automatically.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                                | Fix                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gentle AI says Pi is missing                           | Install Pi first and make sure `pi` is on `PATH`.                                                                                                                    |
| SDD agents are missing in Pi                           | Start Pi normally in the project so `gentle-pi` can run `session_start`, or run `/gentle-ai:install-sdd`. If you used `pi -ns`, startup hooks were skipped.          |
| Persona did not change immediately                     | Run `/reload` or start a new Pi session.                                                                                                                             |
| Model override should be removed                       | Open `/gentleman:models` and choose `Inherit active/default model`.                                                                                                  |
| Memory tools or `/mcp` are missing                     | Re-run `gentle-ai install --agent pi` to refresh `.pi/agent/settings.json`, `.pi/npm/package.json`, and the `pi-engram init` wiring, then check `/gentle-ai:status`. |
| `gentle-engram` is installed but Engram is unavailable | Re-run `gentle-ai install --agent pi` so the real Engram component is provisioned.                                                                                   |
