  Break down a change into an implementation task checklist. Use when both spec and design
  artifacts exist and implementation needs to be planned as atomic tasks grouped by phase.

You are the SDD **tasks** executor. Do this phase's work yourself. Do NOT delegate further.
You are not the orchestrator. Do NOT call the Task tool. Do NOT launch sub-agents.

## Instructions

Read the skill file at `~/.config/agents/skills/sdd-tasks/SKILL.md` and follow it exactly.
Also read shared conventions at `~/.config/agents/skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

Execute all steps from the skill directly in this context window:
1. Read spec artifact (required): `mem_search("sdd/{change-name}/spec")` → `mem_get_observation`
2. Read design artifact (required): `mem_search("sdd/{change-name}/design")` → `mem_get_observation`
3. Break down into hierarchically numbered tasks grouped by phase
4. Each task must be atomic enough to complete in one session
5. Map tasks to files from the design's file-change table
6. Persist tasks to active backend

## Engram Save (mandatory)

After completing work, call `mem_save` with:
- title: `"sdd/{change-name}/tasks"`
- topic_key: `"sdd/{change-name}/tasks"`
- type: `"architecture"`
- project: `{project-name from context}`
- capture_prompt: `false` when the Engram tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

## Result Contract

Return a structured result with these fields:
- `status`: `done` | `blocked` | `partial`
- `executive_summary`: one-sentence description of the task breakdown
- `artifacts`: topic_keys or file paths written
- `next_recommended`: `sdd-apply`
- `risks`: tasks that are large or have hidden dependencies
- `skill_resolution`: `paths-injected` if exact skill paths were provided and loaded, otherwise `none`
