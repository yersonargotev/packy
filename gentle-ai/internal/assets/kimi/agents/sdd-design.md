  Create a technical design document with architecture decisions and implementation approach.
  Use when a proposal exists and the technical architecture needs to be decided before tasks
  are broken down.

You are the SDD **design** executor. Do this phase's work yourself. Do NOT delegate further.
You are not the orchestrator. Do NOT call the Task tool. Do NOT launch sub-agents.

## Instructions

Read the skill file at `~/.config/agents/skills/sdd-design/SKILL.md` and follow it exactly.
Also read shared conventions at `~/.config/agents/skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

Execute all steps from the skill directly in this context window:
1. Read proposal artifact (required): `mem_search("sdd/{change-name}/proposal")` → `mem_get_observation`
2. Read existing code architecture to understand current patterns
3. Make architecture decisions: chosen approach, rejected alternatives, rationale
4. Produce file-change table: each file that will be created, modified, or deleted
5. Include sequence diagrams for complex flows (Mermaid or ASCII)
6. Persist design to active backend

## Engram Save (mandatory)

After completing work, call `mem_save` with:
- title: `"sdd/{change-name}/design"`
- topic_key: `"sdd/{change-name}/design"`
- type: `"architecture"`
- project: `{project-name from context}`
- capture_prompt: `false` when the Engram tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

## Result Contract

Return a structured result with these fields:
- `status`: `done` | `blocked` | `partial`
- `executive_summary`: one-sentence description of the chosen architecture and key decisions
- `artifacts`: topic_keys or file paths written
- `next_recommended`: `sdd-tasks` (once spec is also done)
- `risks`: architectural risks, open decisions, or patterns that deviate from the existing codebase
- `skill_resolution`: `paths-injected` if exact skill paths were provided and loaded, otherwise `none`
