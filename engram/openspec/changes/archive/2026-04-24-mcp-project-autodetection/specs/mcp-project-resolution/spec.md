# MCP Project Resolution Specification

## Purpose

Authoritative project resolution for all MCP tool calls. Eliminates LLM-supplied project names on writes by auto-detecting from the working directory. Validates optional overrides on reads. Exposes detection as a first-class discovery tool. Covers five cwd cases with structured results and error envelopes.

---

## Requirements

### Requirement: REQ-300 DetectProjectFull Contract

The system MUST expose `DetectProjectFull(dir string) DetectionResult` where `DetectionResult` carries `Project string`, `Source string`, `Path string`, `Warning string` (optional), `Error error` (optional), and `AvailableProjects []string` (populated only when `Error` is `ErrAmbiguousProject`).

#### Scenario: Happy path — successful detection

- GIVEN a directory resolvable to a git repo
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called with that directory
- THEN the result has a non-empty `Project`, a non-empty `Source`, a non-empty `Path`, and `Error` is nil

#### Scenario: Ambiguous directory

- GIVEN a directory that is a parent of multiple git repos
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN `Error` equals `ErrAmbiguousProject` AND `AvailableProjects` contains one entry per detected child repo AND `Project` is empty

#### Scenario: Zero-repo fallback

- GIVEN a directory with no git repo at or near it
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN `Project` equals the basename of the directory AND `Source` equals `"dir_basename"` AND `Error` is nil

---

### Requirement: REQ-301 Case 1 — cwd Is Repo Root (git_remote)

When the working directory is the root of a git repository, the system MUST set `Source` to `"git_remote"` and derive `Project` from the remote URL basename (without `.git` suffix).

#### Scenario: Directory is a git repo root with a remote

- GIVEN a directory that is a git root with a configured remote origin URL
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN `Source` is `"git_remote"` AND `Project` matches the repository name from the remote URL AND `Path` equals the directory

#### Scenario: Repo root with no remote configured

- GIVEN a directory that is a git root with no remote
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN the system falls through to Case 2 (`git_root` source using directory basename) without error

---

### Requirement: REQ-302 Case 2 — cwd Is Subdirectory of a Repo (git_root)

When the working directory is inside a git repository (but not its root), the system MUST walk up to the repo root, set `Source` to `"git_root"`, and set `Path` to the repo root directory.

#### Scenario: Working directory is a subdirectory

- GIVEN a directory that is two levels deep inside a git repository
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN `Source` is `"git_root"` AND `Path` equals the ancestor git root directory AND `Project` is the repo root's basename

#### Scenario: Boundary — git root itself routes to Case 1 first

- GIVEN a directory that is both a git root and has a remote configured
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN `Source` is `"git_remote"`, not `"git_root"` (Case 1 takes priority)

---

### Requirement: REQ-303 Case 3 — cwd Is Parent of Exactly One Repo Child (git_child)

When the working directory contains exactly one child directory that is a git repository, the system MUST auto-promote that child, set `Source` to `"git_child"`, populate `Warning` describing the promotion, and set `Project` and `Path` to the child repo's values.

#### Scenario: Single git child found

- GIVEN a directory containing exactly one subdirectory that is a git repository
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN `Source` is `"git_child"` AND `Project` equals the child repo's name AND `Warning` is non-empty describing the auto-promotion AND `Error` is nil

#### Scenario: Warning is surfaced in tool response

- GIVEN a cwd that triggers Case 3
- WHEN any MCP write tool is called from that directory
- THEN the tool response includes the `Warning` field with the promotion message

---

### Requirement: REQ-304 Case 4 — cwd Is Parent of Multiple Repo Children (ambiguous_project)

When the working directory contains more than one child directory that is a git repository, the system MUST return `ErrAmbiguousProject` with `AvailableProjects` listing all found child repo names and set `Project` to empty.

#### Scenario: Multiple git children found

- GIVEN a directory containing two or more subdirectory git repositories
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN `Error` equals `ErrAmbiguousProject` AND `AvailableProjects` lists every detected child repo AND `Project` is empty string

#### Scenario: Write tool fails fast on ambiguous cwd

- GIVEN a cwd that is a parent of multiple git repos
- WHEN a write tool (e.g., `mem_save`) is called
- THEN the tool returns a structured error with `error_code: "ambiguous_project"` AND `available_projects` populated AND no memory is written

---

### Requirement: REQ-305 Case 5 — cwd Without Any Repos Nearby (dir_basename)

When the working directory is not in or adjacent to any git repository, the system MUST set `Source` to `"dir_basename"` and set `Project` to the basename of the working directory.

#### Scenario: No repos anywhere nearby

- GIVEN a directory with no `.git` folder at any ancestor and no git-repo children
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN `Source` is `"dir_basename"` AND `Project` equals `filepath.Base(dir)` AND `Error` is nil AND `Warning` is empty

#### Scenario: Basename used even for unusual directory names

- GIVEN a directory named `my-project-2026` with no git context
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` is called
- THEN `Project` is `"my-project-2026"`

---

### Requirement: REQ-306 Child Scan Constraints

The child-directory scan MUST operate at depth=1 only, inspect at most 20 directory entries, skip hidden directories and the noise set (`node_modules`, `vendor`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `target`, `dist`, `build`), enforce a 200ms wall-clock timeout, and short-circuit as soon as more than 1 git repository is found.

#### Scenario: Scan stops after finding two repos

- GIVEN a directory containing 10 child directories, the first two being git repos
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` runs the child scan
- THEN the scan stops after confirming 2 repos and returns `ErrAmbiguousProject` without reading the remaining 8 entries

#### Scenario: Noise directories are skipped

- GIVEN a directory containing `node_modules/` (with a `.git` inside) and one legitimate repo
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` runs the child scan
- THEN `node_modules` is not counted AND the single legitimate repo is auto-promoted (Case 3)

#### Scenario: Hidden directories are skipped

- GIVEN a directory containing `.hidden-repo/` with `.git` and one other repo
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` runs the child scan
- THEN `.hidden-repo` is not counted AND the visible repo is auto-promoted

#### Scenario: Timeout enforced

- GIVEN a directory scan that would exceed 200ms (simulated via test seam)
- WHEN `DetectProjectFull` runs the child scan
- THEN the function returns before or at the timeout AND falls through to Case 5 (dir_basename)

---

### Requirement: REQ-307 DetectProject Backward-Compatibility Wrapper

`DetectProject(dir string) string` MUST delegate entirely to `DetectProjectFull(dir)` and return `.Project`, preserving the existing CLI contract without duplicating logic.

#### Scenario: Same result as DetectProjectFull.Project

- GIVEN any directory
- WHEN both `DetectProject` and `DetectProjectFull` are called with it
- THEN `DetectProject` returns the same value as `DetectProjectFull(dir).Project`

#### Scenario: Ambiguous cwd returns empty string (not an error)

- GIVEN a directory that triggers `ErrAmbiguousProject`
- WHEN `DetectProject` is called
- THEN it returns `""` (the wrapper surfaces no error to the CLI caller)

---

### Requirement: REQ-308 Write Tools Remove project Field From Schema

The MCP write tools (`mem_save`, `mem_save_prompt`, `mem_session_start`, `mem_session_end`, `mem_capture_passive`, `mem_update`) MUST NOT include a `project` field in their JSON schema. Each handler MUST call `resolveWriteProject` using the server's working directory and ignore any `project` argument supplied by the LLM.

#### Scenario: LLM-supplied project is silently discarded

- GIVEN a call to `mem_save` with an explicit `project` argument
- WHEN the handler processes the request
- THEN the observation is stored under the auto-detected project, not the LLM-supplied value, and no error is returned

#### Scenario: Schema omits project field

- GIVEN the MCP tool-list response
- WHEN a client inspects the input schema for `mem_save`
- THEN the schema has no `project` property

---

### Requirement: REQ-309 Write Tools Fail Fast on ErrAmbiguousProject

When `resolveWriteProject` returns `ErrAmbiguousProject`, write tool handlers MUST return a structured error envelope without writing any data.

#### Scenario: Structured error envelope returned

- GIVEN a cwd that is a parent of multiple git repos
- WHEN `mem_save` is called
- THEN the handler returns `{error: "ambiguous_project", message: "...", available_projects: [...]}` AND the store write is not executed

#### Scenario: Non-ambiguous write succeeds

- GIVEN a cwd that resolves to a single project (any source)
- WHEN `mem_save` is called
- THEN the handler writes the observation AND returns `{..., project, project_source, project_path}` with no error field

---

### Requirement: REQ-310 Read Tools Accept Optional project Field

The MCP read tools (`mem_search`, `mem_context`, `mem_timeline`, `mem_get_observation`, `mem_stats`) MUST include `project` as an OPTIONAL field in their JSON schema. When `project` is omitted or empty, the handler MUST fall back to auto-detection via `DetectProjectFull`.

#### Scenario: Omitted project falls back to auto-detect

- GIVEN a call to `mem_search` with no `project` argument
- WHEN the handler processes the request
- THEN results are scoped to the auto-detected project

#### Scenario: Explicit project is forwarded for validation

- GIVEN a call to `mem_search` with `project: "known-project"`
- WHEN the handler processes the request
- THEN `store.ProjectExists("known-project")` is called before executing the query

---

### Requirement: REQ-311 Read Tools Validate Explicit Project Override

When a read tool receives a non-empty `project`, the handler MUST call `store.ProjectExists`. If the project is unknown, the handler MUST return a structured error with `available_projects`. If known, proceed normally.

#### Scenario: Known project proceeds normally

- GIVEN `project: "engram"` is supplied AND `ProjectExists("engram")` returns true
- WHEN a read tool is called
- THEN the tool executes and returns results scoped to `"engram"`

#### Scenario: Unknown project returns structured error

- GIVEN `project: "does-not-exist"` is supplied AND `ProjectExists` returns false
- WHEN a read tool is called
- THEN the handler returns `{error: "unknown_project", available_projects: [...]}` and no results

---

### Requirement: REQ-312 Admin Tools Require Explicit project

The admin tools (`mem_delete`, `mem_merge_projects`) MUST keep `project` as a REQUIRED field in their schema. Auto-detection is NOT applied to admin tools.

#### Scenario: Schema requires project

- GIVEN the MCP tool-list response
- WHEN a client inspects the input schema for `mem_delete`
- THEN the schema marks `project` as required

#### Scenario: Missing project returns validation error

- GIVEN a call to `mem_delete` with no `project` argument
- WHEN the handler processes the request
- THEN a validation error is returned before any deletion occurs

---

### Requirement: REQ-313 mem_current_project Discovery Tool

The system MUST register a new `mem_current_project` tool that returns `{project, project_source, project_path, cwd, available_projects, warning}` for every cwd case, including ambiguous. The tool MUST NOT error — it always returns a result (for ambiguous: `project` empty, `available_projects` populated).

#### Scenario: Normal detection returns full metadata

- GIVEN a cwd that resolves to a single project
- WHEN `mem_current_project` is called
- THEN the response includes non-empty `project`, `project_source`, `project_path`, and the `cwd` used

#### Scenario: Ambiguous cwd returns available_projects without error

- GIVEN a cwd that is a parent of multiple git repos
- WHEN `mem_current_project` is called
- THEN `project` is empty, `available_projects` lists the repo names, and the tool does not return an error-level response

#### Scenario: Warning is included when Case 3 triggers

- GIVEN a cwd auto-promoting a single child repo
- WHEN `mem_current_project` is called
- THEN `warning` is non-empty AND `project_source` is `"git_child"`

---

### Requirement: REQ-314 Standardized Response Envelope

Every MCP tool response MUST include `project`, `project_source`, and `project_path` fields reflecting the project used. Error responses MUST include `available_projects` whenever the error relates to project resolution.

#### Scenario: Successful tool response includes project metadata

- GIVEN a successful call to any MCP tool (read or write)
- WHEN the response is returned
- THEN `project`, `project_source`, and `project_path` are present at the top level

#### Scenario: Error response includes available_projects when applicable

- GIVEN a call that fails with `ErrAmbiguousProject` or `unknown_project`
- WHEN the error response is returned
- THEN `available_projects` is a non-empty array in the response body

---

### Requirement: REQ-315 store.ProjectExists

`store.Store` MUST expose `ProjectExists(name string) (bool, error)` that returns `true` if the named project has at least one record in any of `observations`, `sessions`, `prompts`, or `enrollment` tables, using a single `UNION ... LIMIT 1` query for efficiency.

#### Scenario: Known project returns true

- GIVEN a project that has observations in the store
- WHEN `ProjectExists` is called with that project's name
- THEN it returns `true, nil`

#### Scenario: Unknown project returns false

- GIVEN a project name not present in any table
- WHEN `ProjectExists` is called
- THEN it returns `false, nil`

#### Scenario: Empty store returns false for any name

- GIVEN a freshly initialized store with no data
- WHEN `ProjectExists` is called with any name
- THEN it returns `false, nil`
