## Build & Tests Execution

**Build / Type-check**: ⚠️ Not run as a separate step (no `openspec/config.yaml` verify build command present; project policy states “Never build after changes”).

**Tests**: ✅ Passed

- `go test -count=1 ./cmd/engram ./internal/store ./internal/sync ./internal/cloud/... ./internal/server` → pass
- `go test ./...` → pass (exit code 0)
- Targeted strict evidence re-runs (all pass):
  - `go test -count=1 -v ./cmd/engram -run 'TestCmdCloudUpgradeHelpShowsGuidedWorkflow|TestCmdCloudUpgradeDoctorRequiresProjectAndIsDeterministic|TestCmdCloudUpgradeBootstrapStatusAndRollbackSemantics|TestCloudUpgradeDocsMatchHelpAndLocalFirstSemantics|TestCmdSyncCloudRegressionPreservesLegacyBehaviorWithUpgradeStatePresent'`
  - `go test -count=1 -v ./internal/store -run 'TestUpgradeStateSnapshotLifecycle|TestUpgradeRepairDryRunAndApply|TestRollbackCloudUpgradeSafetyBoundary'`
  - `go test -count=1 -v ./internal/sync -run 'TestUpgradeDeterministicReasonCodes|TestUpgradeBootstrapCheckpointResume|TestRollbackProjectInvokesAutosyncHooksAndHonorsBoundary|TestCloudSyncExportBehaviorUnchangedWhenUpgradeStateExists'`
  - `go test -count=1 -v ./internal/cloud/cloudserver -run 'TestHandlerPushValidationErrorsExposeMachineActionableClasses'`
  - `go test -count=1 -v ./internal/cloud/remote -run 'TestReadManifestParsesMachineActionableErrorPayload'`
  - `go test -count=1 -v ./internal/cloud/dashboard -run 'TestHandlerWithStatusRendersUpgradePhaseAndReasonParity'`
  - `go test -count=1 -v ./internal/server -run 'TestSyncStatusIncludesReasonParityFields'`

**Coverage**: ✅ Available (`go test -cover ./...` + `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...`)
- Reported total: **80.8%** statements
- Threshold: ➖ Not configured (`openspec/config.yaml` absent)

---

## TDD Compliance (Strict)

`apply-progress.md` includes initial + continuation **TDD Cycle Evidence** tables.

| Check | Result | Details |
|---|---|---|
| TDD Evidence reported | ✅ | Table present (including continuation rows for blocker closure) |
| All tasks have tests | ✅ | Task-linked test files exist for all RED/GREEN pairs in apply-progress |
| RED confirmed (tests exist) | ✅ | Referenced test files verified in repo |
| GREEN confirmed (tests pass now) | ✅ | Full and targeted test re-runs pass |
| Triangulation adequate | ✅ | Multi-case assertions present (doctor determinism + policy denied + repair matrix + bootstrap resume/no-op + rollback boundaries + docs parity) |
| Safety Net for modified files | ✅ | Safety-net commands recorded in each apply-progress row |

**TDD Compliance**: **6/6 checks passed**

---

## Test Layer Distribution (change-related)

Based on test files tracked in `apply-progress.md` (plus continuation additions):

| Layer | Tests | Files | Tools |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Unit | 13+ | 6 | `go test` |
| Integration-ish unit | 2+ | 2 | `go test` |
| E2E | 0 | 0 | not used |
| **Total** | **15+** | **8** | |

Note: `+` indicates additional scenario-level subtests added in continuation rows.

---

## Changed File Coverage (Strict Step 5d)

From `go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...` + `go tool cover -func=coverage.out`:

| File | Coverage Evidence | Rating |
|---|---|---|
| `internal/sync/upgrade.go` | `DiagnoseCloudUpgrade` 100.0% | ✅ Excellent |
| `cmd/engram/cloud.go` | `cmdCloudUpgradeDoctor` 75.7%, `cloudUpgradePolicyDenied` 83.3%, `cmdCloudUpgradeBootstrap` 52.9%, `captureUpgradeSnapshotBeforeBootstrap` 80.0%, `cmdCloudUpgradeStatus` 54.2%, `cmdCloudUpgradeRollback` 37.8%, `cmdCloudUpgradeRepair` 0.0% | ⚠️ Mixed (several low paths) |
| `internal/store/store.go` | `RepairCloudUpgrade` 77.8%, `cloudUpgradeManualActionReport` 78.9%, `RollbackCloudUpgrade` 69.0%, `CanRollbackCloudUpgrade` 66.7% | ⚠️ Acceptable/Low mix |
| `internal/sync/sync.go` | `BootstrapProject` 65.2%, `RollbackProject` 65.2% | ⚠️ Low |
| `internal/cloud/cloudserver/cloudserver.go` | `handlePushChunk` 77.2%, `writeActionableError` 100% | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| `internal/cloud/remote/transport.go` | `ReadManifest` 77.8%, `newHTTPStatusError` 100% | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| `internal/cloud/dashboard/dashboard.go` | `renderSyncStatusPage` 100.0% | ✅ Excellent |
| `internal/server/server.go` | `handleSyncStatus` 100.0% | ✅ Excellent |
| `internal/cloud/autosync/manager.go` | `StopForUpgrade`/`ResumeAfterUpgrade` 0.0% | ⚠️ Low |

**Average changed-file coverage**: ⚠️ Mixed. Total suite coverage is healthy (80.8%), but several upgrade-critical command/orchestration paths are under 80%.

---

## Assertion Quality (Strict Step 5f)

Audited change-related test files listed in `apply-progress.md` (with emphasis on continuation-modified tests in `cmd/engram/main_extra_test.go` and `internal/store/store_test.go`) for trivial assertions (tautologies, empty ghost loops, assertion-without-production-call, smoke-only checks).

**Assertion quality**: ✅ All inspected assertions verify behavior; no CRITICAL trivial assertion patterns found.

---

## Quality Metrics (Strict Step 5e)

**Linter**: ➖ Not run (no cached/project linter command provided in artifacts)  
**Type Checker**: ➖ Not run separately (no configured command; Go compile checks exercised through `go test`)

## Correctness (Static — structural evidence)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-UPGRADE-01 | ✅ Implemented | CLI surface/help and explicit `--project` validation present in `cmd/engram/cloud.go`. |
| REQ-UPGRADE-02 | ✅ Implemented | Deterministic diagnosis (`internal/sync/upgrade.go`) plus runtime policy-denied signal wiring (`cloudUpgradePolicyDenied` in `cmd/engram/cloud.go`). |
| REQ-UPGRADE-03 | ✅ Implemented | `RepairCloudUpgrade` is local-only and blocks auth/policy paths with manual-action-required semantics. |
| REQ-UPGRADE-04 | ✅ Implemented | Checkpointed idempotent bootstrap orchestration in `internal/sync/sync.go`. |
| REQ-UPGRADE-05 | ✅ Implemented | Pre-bootstrap snapshot capture now wired in production path (`captureUpgradeSnapshotBeforeBootstrap`) and rollback boundary enforced. |
| REQ-UPGRADE-06 | ✅ Implemented | Docs and docs-parity test align command forms + local-first semantics + deferred plugin automation notes. |

---

## Coherence (Design)

| Decision | Followed? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Additive command shape (`doctor|repair|bootstrap|status|rollback`) | ✅ Yes | Implemented in `cmd/engram/cloud.go`. |
| Store-owned upgrade state/checkpoints | ✅ Yes | Implemented in `internal/store/store.go`. |
| Bootstrap via existing sync engine with checkpoint resume | ✅ Yes | Implemented in `internal/sync/sync.go`. |
| Repair boundaries local-safe, no remote mutation | ✅ Yes | Implemented via store/cloudserver/remote boundaries. |
| Reason/stage parity across CLI/server/dashboard | ✅ Yes | Covered by dashboard + `/sync/status` tests. |
| Design shorthand `engram cloud upgrade --project --server => guided chain` | ⚠️ Deviated | Not present in current CLI implementation; explicit subcommands remain required. |

## Issues Found

### CRITICAL (must fix before archive)

None.

### WARNING (should fix)

1. **Coverage on several upgrade-critical paths remains low** (`cmd/engram/cloud.go` upgrade handlers, `internal/sync/sync.go` bootstrap/rollback orchestration, `internal/cloud/autosync/manager.go`).
2. **Design deviation remains on shorthand invocation path** (`engram cloud upgrade --project --server` chain not implemented). This is non-blocking relative to current spec, but should be reconciled in future design/spec sync.
3. **Standalone build/type-check command is not configured/executed** in OpenSpec verify artifacts (non-blocking under current repo policy).

### SUGGESTION (nice to have)

1. Add targeted coverage for low-percentage command branches (`repair`, rollback error branches, autosync manager hooks).
2. Add a small design follow-up to either implement or formally remove shorthand-chain behavior from `design.md`.

---

## Follow-up Verification Addendum (2026-04-23)

Requested follow-ups were implemented and re-verified:

1. **Targeted coverage improvements** for upgrade-critical command/orchestration branches
2. **Design alignment** to remove shorthand behavior not implemented in CLI

### Evidence

- New/extended tests:
  - `cmd/engram/main_extra_test.go` → `TestCmdCloudUpgradeRepairStatusAndRollbackBranches`
  - `internal/sync/sync_test.go` → `TestBootstrapProjectValidationAndCreatedByDefault`, `TestRollbackProjectHandlesHookFailures`
  - `internal/cloud/autosync/manager_test.go` (new)
- Design update:
  - `openspec/changes/cloud-upgrade-path-existing-users/design.md` command-shape row now explicitly documents subcommand-only invocation and no implicit shorthand chain.

### Coverage delta (targeted functions)

From `coverage.out` function report after follow-up:

- `cmd/engram/cloud.go`
  - `cmdCloudUpgradeRepair`: **81.0%** (from 0.0%)
  - `cmdCloudUpgradeStatus`: **66.7%** (from 54.2%)
  - `cmdCloudUpgradeRollback`: **62.2%** (from 37.8%)
- `internal/sync/sync.go`
  - `BootstrapProject`: **78.3%** (from 65.2%)
  - `RollbackProject`: **87.0%** (from 65.2%)
- `internal/cloud/autosync/manager.go`
  - `StopForUpgrade`: **100%** (from 0.0%)
  - `ResumeAfterUpgrade`: **100%** (from 0.0%)

### Follow-up test execution

- `go test ./cmd/engram -run 'TestCmdCloudUpgradeRepairStatusAndRollbackBranches'`
- `go test ./internal/sync -run 'TestBootstrapProjectValidationAndCreatedByDefault|TestRollbackProjectHandlesHookFailures'`
- `go test ./internal/cloud/autosync -run 'TestManagerStopForUpgradeRequiresProject|TestManagerStopAndResumeUpgradeTransitions|TestManagerResumeAfterUpgradeRequiresProject'`
- `go test ./cmd/engram ./internal/sync ./internal/cloud/autosync`
- `go test ./...`
- `go test -cover ./...`

Result: ✅ all follow-up commands pass.
