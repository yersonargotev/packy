# Advisory governance and security checks

Issue [#169](https://github.com/yersonargotev/packy/issues/169) introduces the
repository policy surface and five check identities below. They are informative
only: no branch protection or repository ruleset requires them in this stage.

## Stable identity and source registry

| Qualified check identity | Workflow / job | Expected source | Advisory behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CI / Validate Packy-owned code` | `CI` / `Validate Packy-owned code` | GitHub Actions; App ID `15368`, slug `github-actions` | Runs repository validation, the complete Go test suite (through validation), and advisory `govulncheck`; vulnerability findings remain visible without becoming required in this stage. |
| `CI / Claude 2.1.203 package smoke` | `CI` / `Claude 2.1.203 package smoke` | GitHub Actions; App ID `15368`, slug `github-actions` | Runs the exact supported Claude floor on pull requests. |
| `Governance / Validate authorization` | Protected `Governance` workflow commit status | GitHub Actions; App ID `15368`, slug `github-actions` | Accepts open, same-repository closing issues with exactly `status:approved`; every absent, ambiguous, stale, or cross-repository state is denied. |
| `Security / CodeQL` | `Security` / `CodeQL` | GitHub Actions; App ID `15368`, slug `github-actions` | Uploads Go analysis without becoming a merge requirement. |
| `Security / Dependency review` | `Security` / `Dependency review` | GitHub Actions; App ID `15368`, slug `github-actions` | Reports dependency risk with warning semantics; operational errors remain visible in the step result. |

The expected source is a policy binding, not proof. Issue #172 must observe each
exact name and App identity on current-head runs before any later ruleset can
require it. A rename or source mismatch stops promotion.

## Authorization boundary

The Governance workflow uses `pull_request_target` only to read pull-request and
issue metadata. It checks out the exact base SHA, never the proposed head, and
grants read-only metadata access plus the minimum `statuses: write` needed to
bind its result to the current PR head. Per-PR concurrency cancels stale runs so
an older approved snapshot cannot overwrite a later revocation. The checked-in
validator has no network or mutation capability.

The trusted workflow queries GitHub for the pull request's closing issues and
passes the projected fields to `internal/governanceauth`. The validator fails
closed unless the PR targets the default branch and every same-repository issue
that closes it is open and carries exactly one approved delivery status. Issue
label, close, and reopen events recompute affected open PRs so revoked evidence
cannot leave a stale successful result.

An ordinary PR uses GitHub-recognized closing references. A policy exception
uses exactly these two lines in the PR body:

```text
Authorization-Exception: private-security|urgent-revert|automation
Authorization-Record: https://github.com/yersonargotev/packy/<canonical-record>
```

`private-security` accepts an accessible active repository security advisory;
`urgent-revert` accepts an open same-repository retrospective issue; and
`automation` accepts a successful completed same-repository Actions run. The
validator rejects unknown or duplicate headers, mixed issue/exception evidence,
cross-repository records, inaccessible records, noncanonical URLs, and failed or
stale record state. Completion of the two protected proposal workflows
recomputes their associated PRs.

CI and Security also run weekly. Dependency Review compares the current commit
with its first parent outside pull-request events, so scheduled and `main` runs
remain metadata-only and advisory.

Positive and negative JSON fixtures live under
`internal/governanceauth/testdata/`. Run them with:

```bash
go test ./internal/governanceauth ./internal/tools/governanceauth
```

Secret Scanning and Push Protection remain GitHub platform controls. These
workflows do not read secrets, approve pull requests, change issues, write
repository contents, or alter repository settings.
