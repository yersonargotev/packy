# Packy v0.1.7 cutover baseline

Status: frozen  
Window opened: 2026-07-18T02:52:21Z  
Source ticket: [#56](https://github.com/yersonargotev/matty/issues/56)

This document opens the controlled Packy cutover window and binds its initial
inputs before any product identity changes. The command-level record, including
timestamps, tool versions, exit statuses, and complete outputs, is in
[`evidence/issue-56/baseline.log`](evidence/issue-56/baseline.log).

## Freeze contract

- Ordinary releases are frozen. The only permitted release path is the
  controlled `v0.1.7` publication in issue #63, from the exact Packy `main` SHA
  accepted by issues #60 and #62.
- Pack-source synchronization is fully frozen. No manual dispatch may start
  until issue #66 completes the final audit and explicitly reopens automation.
- The release workflow must not be dispatched and no `v0.*.*` tag may be
  created before issue #63. Same-tag recovery is permitted only for idempotent
  completion at the unchanged `v0.1.7` tag SHA.
- Any conflicting run, namespace collision, invalidated SHA, or changed
  publication input stops the cutover and requires fresh evidence.

The workflows are intentionally still enabled: pack-source synchronization is
manual-only, while disabling the release workflow would also disable the one
permitted `v0.1.7` path. The freeze is the explicit operational allowlist above,
recorded in the repository and on issue #56. At the opening probe there were no
queued or in-progress runs.

## Bound inputs

| Input | Bound value |
| --- | --- |
| Pre-rename base | `0e8971ad4ccacad5f99ec97d05ed963830b58070` |
| Base relationship | `HEAD`, local `main`, and `origin/main` were equal before worktree creation |
| Candidate branch | `feat/packy-atomic-cutover` |
| Candidate starting HEAD | `0e8971ad4ccacad5f99ec97d05ed963830b58070` |
| Migration batches | #57 executable/local ownership; #58 automation/distribution/docs; #59 schema suite |
| Integration gate | #60 binds and proves the final unchanged candidate SHA |
| Accepted inputs | #50 identity classification; #51 external constraints; #52 install/state contract; #53 ordering; #54 acceptance contract; #55 schema identity |
| Planned PR boundary | One atomic identity PR containing #57-#60; no partial identity merge |

There is no candidate SHA yet. Issue #60 must record it after all three migration
batches and acceptance automation are assembled; this baseline must not be
misread as binding a future, unknown commit.

## Immediate external recheck

The opening probes found no blocking collision:

- `yersonargotev/packy` did not exist; `yersonargotev/matty` remained the public
  source repository with default branch `main`.
- `yersonargotev/homebrew-tap` contained `Formula/matty.rb`, no
  `Formula/packy.rb`, and no `formula_renames.json`.
- Homebrew/core contained neither an expected-path Matty formula nor an
  expected-path Packy formula.
- `https://yersonargotev.github.io/` and `/packy/` both returned HTTP 404.
- GitHub reported no queued or in-progress Matty Actions run.

The expected absence probes return non-zero status for GitHub 404 responses;
those statuses are evidence of a free namespace, not ignored command failures.
All namespace and workflow probes must run again immediately before issue #61.

## Historical Matty recovery proof

The historical public inputs are mutually consistent:

- tag `v0.1.6` resolves to commit
  `68aec8969374fa9e9a6ea86b33e6719646b999f8`;
- the published release is neither draft nor prerelease and exposes
  `checksums.txt` plus the four expected raw Matty executables;
- all four downloaded files passed the published SHA-256 manifest;
- every tap formula URL and SHA-256 matched the corresponding downloaded file;
- the downloaded Darwin arm64 executable ran in isolated `HOME` and
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` roots and reported `matty version v0.1.6`;
- the current tap formula is version `0.1.6`, installs `matty`, and tests
  `matty --version`.

These checks establish obtainability and byte consistency. The full disposable
historical installation lifecycle remains the separate acceptance gate in #64.

## Maintainer recovery boundary

Only read-only observations were made against the maintainer installation:

- Homebrew Matty `0.1.6` is installed and `/opt/homebrew/bin/matty` reports
  `v0.1.6`.
- `matty doctor --json` is healthy and `matty uninstall --dry-run` produced the
  expected owned-removal plan without applying it.
- `~/.matty/config.json` and `~/.matty/backups/` exist; pack intent and lock
  files are absent. The three known recovery files are still present.
- `~/.local/share/matty` is a clean detached checkout at tag `v0.1.4`, commit
  `f348b84e50222a4eeadf5abbcedef7a24974cd88`.
- The approved destination
  `~/Documents/dev/backups/matty-to-packy-cutover-20260717/` and its parent do
  not exist yet. Issue #65, not this ticket, creates, hashes, and verifies that
  copy before any legacy deletion.

Targeted `matty` pack status probes show absent intent on both supported
surfaces. Aggregate status and the targeted Engram/OpenCode probe report an
unmanaged existing Engram MCP configuration. This is accepted baseline external
ownership under issue #52: Packy and Matty must preserve it, must not adopt or
rewrite it, and must re-audit it before #65. It is not an active Matty pack or a
Matty-owned residual.

## Evidence integrity

`evidence/issue-56/SHA256SUMS` binds the durable files created for this gate.
Any edit to this baseline or its raw log requires regenerating that manifest and
re-reviewing issue #56 evidence. Later tickets append their own evidence rather
than rewriting this opening observation.
