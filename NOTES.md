# Workspace Notes

## Packy development

- Source control and delivery use GitHub issues, pull requests, and Actions.
- `./scripts/validate-packy.sh` is the authoritative repository validation
  command required before delivery. Focused checks are iteration aids. While
  the repository has no vendored upstream Go content, `go test ./...` is a
  compatibility check, not a second delivery gate.
- Architecture and symbol discovery use CodeGraph before source inspection;
  runtime behavior is verified with real commands or tests.
- Tests and manual checks that exercise user configuration sandbox `HOME` and
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.
- External project state such as issue labels, pull requests, merges, tags, and
  releases stays with the primary agent.
- `.agents/skills/release-packy` is the existing project-local release skill.

## Canonical loops

- **Issue delivery**: qualify locally, optionally diagnose uncertain bugs, then
  repeat a local `implement -> code-review` loop whose review covers only the
  preceding implementation delta; after local proof, create the PR, wait for
  green CI, merge, and clean up.
- **Release**: publication of a verified `main` commit through the existing
  `release-packy` gate.
