## Codex execution

This is a Codex-specific workflow carried by the Agents convention. A shared Agents binding does not provide Codex tools, model choice, or delegation; use only capabilities authorized and available in the actual client.

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested.

Delegate through the available Codex subagent API; use only its advertised agent types and parameters. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/codex-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise inherit the host model. `inherit-parent` means omit an override, not a model ID. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

# Swarm

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Pick the worker model from the `swarm workers` line in `~/.pstack/codex-models.md`. If the rule or that line is missing, use `inherit-parent`. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit `model` so the workers run on the parent model. If a configured model is unavailable, inherit the host model and disclose the fallback. For a model race, name each arm's model up front. Match reasoning to task difficulty with supported controls and confirmed role preferences. Use standard speed unless urgency calls for fast mode; verification preserves its configured speed. For `auto` or `inherit-parent`, omit model, effort, and speed overrides.
4. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn workers through the available host subagent tool, using only its documented parameters. Give each worker a separate worktree and explicit branch/commit when needed. Use concurrent execution only if available and authorized; otherwise process slices sequentially and report that limitation.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with a result table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
