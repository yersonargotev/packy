# Request normalization and preflight

Load this reference for normalization, preflight, attachment, or dispatch.

## Authority

- Work only inside a checkout whose canonical remote resolves to
  `yersonargotev/packy`, but read authority with `gh api` from remote `main`.
- Require `git`, `gh`, `jq`, active authentication, read access to repository
  contents/Actions/branches/pull requests, and actual workflow-dispatch access.
- Read `bundle/sources.json`, all four versioned dispatch schema suites, and
  `.github/workflows/sync-pack-source.yml` through GitHub's contents API at
  `ref=main`. Confirm the workflow is active and remote `main` resolves.
- Download `scripts/request.sh`, `attach.sh`, `dispatch.sh`, and
  `result-state.sh` from that same observed remote-main commit into a fresh
  temporary directory and execute only those copies. Checkout-local script
  bytes are never operational authority.
- Observe per-source active/pending workflow runs and `sync/<source-id>` for
  v1/v2, or the Pack-scoped queue and `sync/<pack-id>` for v3, plus its open
  PR. These are preflight facts only; the workflow owns deep ownership,
  regression, provenance, divergence, and readiness decisions.
- Never checkout, pull, clone, execute upstream content, or read synchronization
  authority from the local tree. Never change permissions or handle secrets.

Materialize the remote runtime without touching the checkout:

```sh
remote_main_sha="$(gh api repos/yersonargotev/packy/branches/main --jq .commit.sha)"
remote_skill_runtime="$(mktemp -d)"
for script in request.sh attach.sh dispatch.sh result-state.sh; do
  gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' \
    "repos/yersonargotev/packy/contents/.agents/skills/sync-pack-source/scripts/$script?ref=$remote_main_sha" \
    > "$remote_skill_runtime/$script"
  chmod 700 "$remote_skill_runtime/$script"
done
```

Use that same `remote_main_sha` for every subsequent remote contents read.

## Normalize intent

Use schema version 1 for `synchronize` requests. Use schema version 2 with
`operation: register` only when the maintainer explicitly requests admission
of an absent source. A registration request must contain the complete strict
`SourceConfig` as `registration`; its `id` must equal `source_id`, its selector
must agree with the request selector, and its resources must bind the complete
intended source contribution. Canonicalize the configuration by the runtime
rules (including binding order), encode it as two-space-indented JSON with one
trailing newline, and set `registration_sha256` to the lowercase SHA-256 of
those exact bytes. Never infer an absent source registration from an update
request.

Infer `source_id` for synchronization only when an explicitly named configured
source, repository, or pack has exactly one match in remote
`bundle/sources.json`. Ask when zero or multiple sources match. For explicit
registration, require the named source to be absent and derive its complete
configuration from an already reviewed, Packy-owned manifest or specification;
ambiguity in any binding blocks before dispatch.

Use schema version 2 with `operation: reconfigure` only for an explicitly
approved complete replacement of one existing source's binding set. Carry the
complete strict `SourceConfig` as `reconfiguration`, preserving its source ID,
provider, repository, and configured selector. Canonicalize and seal it exactly
like a registration in `reconfiguration_sha256`. Also carry the complete
canonical current-version Pack manifest as `proposed_manifest` and seal its
exact two-space-indented, trailing-LF bytes in `proposed_manifest_sha256`.
Require exact bidirectional equality between the proposed bindings and manifest
resources. Never infer retained bindings, change another source or Pack, or use
reconfiguration to transfer ownership.

Use schema version 3 with `operation: register_bundle` only for the initial
atomic admission of two or more absent Pack Sources into exactly one declared,
previously absent capability `pack_id`. `registrations` is ordered strictly by
source ID. Every member contains one complete strict `SourceConfig` with an
exact full-commit selector and bindings only to that Pack, plus a durable
legal-evidence reference, its lowercase SHA-256, and an explicit
`redistributable: true` disposition. Canonicalize the complete ordered member
array with the runtime rules, encode it as two-space-indented JSON plus one
trailing newline, and set `registration_bundle_sha256` to the digest of those
exact bytes. Carry the canonical `proposed_manifest`, its exact SHA-256, and
`proposed_version`; their identity must agree with `pack_id`, and every
manifest resource must be owned exactly once by the member bindings. Any
missing member, ambiguous ownership, existing Pack/source, mixed selector,
incomplete generation, or incomplete legal fact blocks the complete request.

| Intent | Canonical selector |
| --- | --- |
| stable, generic unambiguous update | `latest-stable`, no `selector_ref` |
| exact published prerelease | `prerelease` plus the exact tag |
| exact commit | `commit` plus one full lowercase 40-character SHA |
| explicit human inspection | requested selector plus `human` mode, no evidence |
| human evidence publication | `commit` plus full resolved SHA, `human`, exact plan/base, canonical evidence |
| exact retry | `commit` plus artifact candidate SHA and `retry_of_run` |

V3 has no top-level selector. A human evidence dispatch repeats the exact
ordered registrations and proposed-generation seals, then binds one composite
classification through `expected_plan_id`, `expected_base_sha`, and
`human_evidence`.
The remote request renderer alone mirrors the first ordered member's
`source_id`, exact `commit` selector, and selector ref into GitHub's legacy
required workflow-dispatch inputs. This preserves the published v1/v2
submission boundary; those transport-only values are not part of the v3
request, are not decoded by the v3 adapter, and carry no member-wise authority.

Default classification is `ai`. Preserve the maintainer's reason faithfully in
`request_reason`; do not embellish it. A retry is exact only after validating
the named run's operational artifact. A pre-resolution failure can become a
new, explicitly labelled stable selection, never an exact retry.

Reject versions without an exact prerelease tag, releases that are not
prereleases, branches, abbreviated/uppercase SHAs, floating or unpublished
refs, and arbitrary tags. Reject Pack IDs for v1/v2; v3 requires exactly one
Pack-scoped identity. Reject all branch, PR, base, version, provenance,
validation, permission, credential, secret,
auto-merge, upstream-byte, executable, repair, or bypass inputs.

Build JSON with `jq`, omitting absent optional properties. Its allowed keys are
exactly those in the matching versioned dispatch schema. Validate it against
that checked-in schema by its canonical `$id`; do not resolve it over the
network. Show the exact JSON before dispatch. Map `human_evidence` to the
workflow transport input `human_evidence_json` and `registration` to
`registration_json`, and `reconfiguration` to `reconfiguration_json`; map the v3 member array to `registrations_json` and the
manifest to `proposed_manifest_json` without changing either canonical value.

## Attach or dispatch

Compute `request_digest` as the lowercase SHA-256 of `jq -cS .` output, including
its trailing newline. For every active or pending run of the canonical workflow
on `main`, compare that digest with its exact run-name identity. For a started
run, also download `request.json`, recompute its digest, and require both values
to agree. Attach only on equality; a malformed or absent identity blocks rather
than permitting a guessed duplicate. The digest is transport identity, not a
canonical request field or synchronization authority.

A distinct admitted request may be dispatched; GitHub's non-cancelling
per-source v1/v2 or per-Pack v3 concurrency owns queueing and pending
supersession. Report the
observed active and pending URLs and never manipulate that queue.

List canonical runs with `databaseId`, `displayTitle`, `status`, and `url`,
download any started run's `request.json` as `<databaseId>-request.json`, then
invoke the remote `attach.sh`. Exit 0 attaches, exit 1 admits dispatch, and exit
2 is ambiguous and blocks. Pending attachment relies on the verified run-name
digest because it cannot yet own an artifact.

Submit stdin JSON exactly once with the remote-main renderer, which adds
only the required transport digest and executes the accepted primary command:

```sh
"$remote_skill_runtime/dispatch.sh" canonical-request.json
```

Require the returned run URL; do not rediscover the run by time or actor. If
dispatch is unavailable, report **bloqueada** and show the exact `gh workflow
run .github/workflows/sync-pack-source.yml --repo yersonargotev/packy --ref
main --json` command plus equivalent Actions UI fields. Instructions are not
success.
