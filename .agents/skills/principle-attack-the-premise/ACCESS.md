## On-demand context

Use the initiating retrieval result's explicit `surface` and `snapshot_id` for
this procedure and every nested request. Read the prepared qualified pstack
entries linked below; native Skill-tool registration and installed siblings are
not required. For a fresh nested descriptor, use:

```sh
packy get skill pstack:<skill> --surface <initiating-surface> --snapshot <initiating-snapshot-id> --json
```

Keep that host and snapshot after catalog selection changes. Missing retained
content requires restoring that exact revision. Another Pack's same-name skill
or a modified native copy cannot replace the selected pstack resource. Optional
routes and comparisons name qualified skills but are not required dependencies.
Obtain an optional route only when selected, with the same host/snapshot and its
own reviewed compatibility; unavailable optional advice does not block this flow.

Resolve references relative to this entry and `resource_root`. Resolve project
inspection and outputs against the user's intended target, with writable scratch
separate from immutable resources. Pass host, snapshot, target, scratch/output
and prepared entry/resource locations to every delegate or handoff. Reading a
resource does not execute it, apply setup, install tools or verify prerequisites.
Preserve this procedure's invocation policy, approvals and capability limits.
Read supporting references only when their procedure branch needs them.

## Codex execution

This is a Codex-specific workflow carried by the Agents convention. A shared Agents binding does not provide Codex tools, model choice, or delegation; use only capabilities authorized and available in the actual client.

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read required pstack skills through the prepared qualified references in this entry. Project skills belong under `.agents/skills`; personal skills under `~/.agents/skills`.

Delegate through the available Codex subagent API; use only its advertised agent types and parameters. Delegate only when current instructions permit it. Read `~/.pstack/codex-models.md` for confirmed role preferences; otherwise inherit the host model. `inherit-parent` means omit an override, not a model ID. Same-model reviewers are not a multi-model panel. When delegation is unavailable, label sequential work as such; a required independent-review gate remains incomplete.

Use accessible current-workspace history and authorized tools. Missing history, live control, scheduling, or external integrations is a reported limitation. Monitoring lasts only while the session actually runs unless a supported scheduler is verified. Preserve the user's scope and authority for messages, merges, deployments, and destructive actions. Required evidence gates remain blocked until real evidence exists.

# Attack the Premise

When two or more fixes that share one premise have failed the same gate, suspect the premise, not the fixes.

**Why:** Each failed fix is evidence against the belief it assumed. A third fix on the same premise spends effort where the evidence already says the cause is not.

**Pattern:**
- **Write the premise down.** The premise is the one sentence that every failed fix assumed.
- **Test the premise before the next fix.** Find an observation that would come out differently if the premise were false, and make it. Look at how the failures are distributed, not only at how large they are. Make the check rerunnable per [pstack:principle-build-the-lever]({{packy.access:pstack:principle-build-the-lever}}).
- **Follow the evidence.** If it contradicts the premise, the cause is elsewhere. Look for what the failures have in common that the premise did not predict. If it confirms the premise, ask the next "why" per [pstack:principle-fix-root-causes]({{packy.access:pstack:principle-fix-root-causes}}). The earlier fixes may have treated a consequence instead of the cause.
- **Remove the condition instead of compensating for it**, per the [pstack:principle-laziness-protocol]({{packy.access:pstack:principle-laziness-protocol}}). If the evidence shows that one part always lands on the losing side, change what puts it there. A mechanism that cleans up after it leaves the cause in place and adds work on every run.

**Stop:** Do not start the next fix before the premise is written down and tested.

This principle is distinct from `pstack:principle-redesign-from-first-principles` (optional background), which rebuilds a design around a new requirement. It questions a fact the current design assumes.
