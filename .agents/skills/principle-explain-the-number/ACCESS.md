description: "Apply before you measure, and before you trust, report, or act on a number you measured: a speedup, a regression, a throughput, a latency, or an eval result. Find what limits it, and rule out that it measured something other than the work you think."

## On-demand context

Use the initiating retrieval result's explicit `surface` and `snapshot_id` for
this procedure and every nested request. Read the prepared qualified pstack
entries linked below; native Skill-tool registration and installed siblings are
not required. For a fresh nested descriptor, use:

```sh
packy get skill pstack:<skill> --surface <initiating-surface> --snapshot <initiating-snapshot-id> --json
```

Keep that host and snapshot after catalog selection changes. Missing retained
content requires restoring that exact revision. Another Pack's same-name skill
or a modified native copy cannot replace the selected pstack resource. Optional
routes and comparisons name qualified skills but are not required dependencies.
Obtain an optional route only when selected, with the same host/snapshot and its
own reviewed compatibility; unavailable optional advice does not block this flow.

Resolve references relative to this entry and `resource_root`. Resolve project
inspection and outputs against the user's intended target, with writable scratch
separate from immutable resources. Pass host, snapshot, target, scratch/output
and prepared entry/resource locations to every delegate or handoff. Reading a
resource does not execute it, apply setup, install tools or verify prerequisites.
Preserve this procedure's invocation policy, approvals and capability limits.
Read supporting references only when their procedure branch needs them.

## Codex execution

This is a Codex-specific workflow carried by the Agents convention. A shared Agents binding does not provide Codex tools, model choice, or delegation; use only capabilities authorized and available in the actual client.

Apply this workflow when explicitly requested, or read it as a dependency of an explicitly requested pstack workflow. Read required pstack skills through the prepared qualified references in this entry. Project skills belong under `.agents/skills`; personal skills under `~/.agents/skills`.


# Explain the Number

- **Write the decision before you run.** Name the result that would change a decision, and the noise floor. Stop when the run-to-run spread is larger than the effect.
- **Ask "why not double?"** Name the resource or code path that bounds the result, such as a core, a lock, the disk, the network, or the load generator itself. Get it from a profile or from system counters taken during a run, then map it to source. A guess from reading the code is not a limiter. If you cannot say why the number is not twice as good, you do not know what you measured.
- **List what else the number could be measuring, and rule out each one with evidence.** The usual suspects are errors, skipped or cached work, code that never ran, an untuned side (one left on default settings), noise, and a piece too small to matter end to end.
- **Keep the evidence with the number.** Put the run count, the spread, and the limiter in the notes or a linked artifact.

For a performance number, run the full procedure with the [pstack:benchmark-checklist]({{packy.access:pstack:benchmark-checklist}}) skill. For an eval result, ask the same of the trials: did every run do the task, does the gap hold across trials and models, and does the scenario matter.

You skipped this when a run started without the result that would change a decision, when the evidence behind a number has no run count, no spread, or no named limiter, or when the time saved is larger than the time the changed piece took.

Distinct from `pstack:principle-prove-it-works` (optional background), which checks that an output is real.
