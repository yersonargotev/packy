# Tickets: Matty core lifecycle deepening

Tracer-bullet slices that move classic install, update, and uninstall behavior
behind the deep Matty core lifecycle module without changing user-visible
behavior. Source: [specification](spec.md) and ADR 0003.

Work the **frontier**: any ticket whose blockers are all done. Clear context
between tickets and use `/implement` for one frontier ticket at a time.
