# Tickets: Matty setup health deepening

An expand-contract sequence that moves base-installation health diagnosis behind
one deep setup health module without changing observable `doctor` behavior.
Source: [specification](spec.md).

Work the **frontier**: any ticket whose blockers are all done. Clear context
between tickets and use `/implement` for one frontier ticket at a time.
