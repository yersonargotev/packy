Type: task
Status: resolved
Blocked by: 05, 06

## Question

Add GitHub Actions release automation for Matty, borrowing the dots release workflow ordering so GitHub Releases and the Homebrew tap cannot drift.

## Acceptance criteria

- Triggers on `v0.*` tags and manual dispatch with an existing tag input.
- Checks out the release tag with full history and builds artifacts/checksums.
- Requires `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` before creating/updating release assets.
- Checks out `yersonargotev/homebrew-tap` with the token and writes `Formula/matty.rb`.
- Prepares and dry-run pushes the tap commit before mutating the GitHub Release.
- Creates GitHub Release with generated notes if missing, uploads `dist/* --clobber`, then pushes the prepared tap commit.
- Release automation tests verify the required ordering.
